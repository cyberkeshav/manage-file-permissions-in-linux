<h1>Managing File Permissions Using Linux Commands</h1>

<h2>Languages And Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Linux</b> 
- <b>Current File Permissions File</b>
  
<h2>Description</h2>

The research team at my (fictitious) organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure. To complete this activity, I performed the following tasks:

<h2>Checking File And Directory Details</h2>

The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to determine the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system.

In the provided screenshot, you can see the command I executed, along with its output. The code uses the 'ls' command with the '-la' option to display a comprehensive listing of all files and directories in the 'projects' directory, including hidden files.

The output shows that there is one directory named 'drafts,' one hidden file named '.project_x.txt,' and five other project files. Each entry in the first column is a 10-character string representing the permissions assigned to each file or directory.

<h2>Describing The Permissions String</h2>

The 10-character string provides essential information about file permissions, specifying which users are authorized to access the file and the specific permissions granted to them:

- The 1st character represents the file type, where "d" indicates a directory, and "-" denotes a regular file.
- The 2nd to 4th characters indicate the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the user. If any of these characters is a hyphen (-), it means that the corresponding permission is not granted to the user.
- The 5th to 7th characters represent the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the group. If any of these characters is a hyphen (-), it indicates that the corresponding permission is not granted to the group.
- The 8th to 10th characters signify the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for others, which encompass all users on the system except for the user and group. A hyphen (-) in any of these characters denotes that the corresponding permission is not granted for others.

For instance, let's consider the file permissions for "project_t.txt" as an example: -rw-rw-r--. Here's what each character represents:

- The first character is a hyphen (-), indicating that "project_t.txt" is a regular file, not a directory.
- The second, fifth, and eighth characters are all "r," indicating that the user, group, and others have read permissions for "project_t.txt."
- The third and sixth characters are "w," signifying that only the user and group have write permissions, while others do not.
- Finally, the fourth, seventh, and tenth characters are hyphens (-), indicating that no user, group, or others have execute permissions for "project_t.txt."

<h2>Changing File Permissions</h2>

In order to enforce the organization's policy of restricting write access to their files, I reviewed the file permissions as previously provided. After analyzing the permissions, I identified that 'project_k.txt' required the removal of write access for 'other' users.

To achieve this, I utilized the following Linux commands:

In the provided screenshot, the initial two lines showcase the commands I executed, while the subsequent lines demonstrate the output generated by the second command. The "chmod" command is utilized to modify the permissions of files and directories. The first argument denotes the permissions to be altered, while the second argument designates the target file or directory. In this specific instance, I revoked the write permissions for others on the "project_k.txt" file. To verify the changes made, I employed "ls -la" to review the updated permissions.

<h2>Changing File Permissions On A Hidden File</h2>

At my organization, the research team has recently archived "project_x.txt." To ensure that no one has write access to this project, we have set the permissions to allow only read access for both the user and the group.

The following Linux commands were used to achieve this:

In the provided screenshot, the initial two lines exhibit the commands I executed, while the subsequent lines reveal the output of the second command. I am aware that the file ".project_x.txt" is a hidden file denoted by the prefix period (.). In this instance, I modified the permissions by eliminating write access for both the user and the group, and concurrently introduced read permissions exclusively for the group. To be precise, I revoked the user's write permission using "u-w" and then eliminated the group's write permission using "g-w," while simultaneously granting the group read permission using "g+r."

<h2>Changing Directory Permissions</h2>

In my organization, exclusive access to the 'drafts' directory and its contents is restricted to the researcher2 user. Only researcher2 should have execute permissions, and no other user should be granted this privilege.

To enforce these permissions, I have utilized Linux commands to modify the access rights. The following code exemplifies the changes made:

In the screenshot provided, the first two lines show the commands I executed, while the subsequent lines display the output of the second command. As I had previously identified that the group had execute permissions, I utilized the chmod command to remove those permissions. However, it was not necessary to add execute permissions for the researcher2 user since they already had them.

<h2>Summary</h2>

To ensure that files and directories in the projects directory aligned with our organization's desired level of authorization, I made several changes to their permissions. The initial step involved checking the existing permissions for the directory using the command "ls -la." This helped inform my subsequent decisions. Afterwards, I utilized the "chmod" command multiple times to modify the permissions on individual files and directories accordingly.
